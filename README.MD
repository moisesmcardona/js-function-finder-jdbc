# JavaScript Function Finder (JDBC version)

This is a project made in JSP (JaveServer Pages) that will analyze your JavaScript code and print the lines where a function has been found.

This is the second of three (3) different projects that I've made for the Advanced Programming course at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, San Juan Campus.

This project uses a MySQL Database to store the account details as well as the analyzed codes, results, and history.

To change the MySQL details, edit the `config.java` file.

There are other options there that must be setup in order to send the account validation email. These options are also found in the `config.java` file.

You'll need to have Tomcat installed in your system to run this project.

The database is included. Import the file `javacodecheck.sql` into your MySQL database.
